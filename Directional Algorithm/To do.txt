createPath 1.0 (features):

- add and implement path object (list of alarms)

- create allPOIs list of every point of interest
	- right now alarms and exits are hardcoded into allAlarms list, use list properties to create alarms

- add and implement visited array based on allPOIs

- change Alarm class to (((Point of Interest))) class
	- include "self.type" (string) property ("alarm", "exit")
	- change allAlarms object name to all(((Point of Interest)))
	- add IDs for self.type: "exit"

- perform "revisits"

- comment up code

- create Test Case modules/file

- Test all scenarios

- Issues:
   X- Infinite loop when looking at connected alarms, due to what is marked as visited, alarms
    just call each other back and forth
   X - First alarm visited not listed in path, not connected to other issue
   X - type "wall" appears as exit?
   X - when path is oo, cannot concatenate to list

key:
- ((( some text ))) -> working title/subject to change
